Eagle Design and OtherMill Notes 
Joshua Wong - 5/5/2022
Eagle Sphericon Circuit Design
	This should be the “motor_tester.brd” file. The circuit itself is the Arduino Nano 33 BLE, the Pololu MDB09X Motor controller, and the holes for a capacitor, motor outputs, and Voltage/Ground inputs. 
	A few notes
	- The traces are wide because of the Trace Net properties
		o This is done BEFORE autorouting
	- The traces are on the back of the “PCB” because the othermill only has one conductive side 
	
Othermill Notes
	• Use a slower tool speed, look into “Tool Library” I was having success with Test #3 so mimic that I guess
	• If there are red spots, go fix them in eagle
	• Use the loading  button to have easier access to bed
	• PUT YOUR TRACES ON THE BACK/BOTTOM LAYER

Instructions 
	1. Load schematic into the Bantum Software and select the tool
		a. Remember that your traces are on the back, so it won’t show until you select the bottom side
	2. Press the “Start milling” button
		a. This will prompt you to change the tool and zero it in
	3. Once the tool is zeroed, cancel the job
	4. Apply double sided tape to the back of your material
	5. Place it down in the bed
		a. Press down firmly to ensure a good fit
	6. Verify that you are milling the bottom/back of the circuit
		a. The traces should be visible
	7. Start the process
	8. Once it finished, vacuum the dust and take your new circuit board
